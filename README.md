# Snippets and Stocks

## Exercise W3D1 Logic & Conditionals

Use logic to debug code snippets and analyze how much stock you can buy

### Estimated Time to Complete

### Learning Objectives

Begin getting comfortable with conditional logic

### Exercise Overview

This assignment has two files of code! 

Follow the instructions in both `snippets.py` and `stocks.py` to complete this exercise. 

Large codebases are split up into multiple files based on what they do. We've seen this with our tests being in their own file, but it also happens when you have chunks of code that are serving different functions. Different teams follow different structures for how this works, but you'll want to get used to working in multiple files either way.

## Getting Started

0. Accept the challenge via the GitHub Classroom link (if you're already here, you've done this part!)
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Follow the instructions in `snippets.py` and 'stocks.py'.

## Unit Testing

Notice that there's a `test` _folder_ in this repo instead of just one test _file_. This allows us to run multiple files of tests at once. As long as your tests are set up correctly (in a folder called `test`, with files inside whose names start with the prefix `test`, and that has an `__init__.py` file), running `python3 -m unittest` will run ALL of your test files.


3. From the main folder of the challenge, run your computer's version of `python3 -m unittest` to see if your code works as expected.

REMEMBER: Comment out or delete the calls to your functions -- the test will not run with them!

## Git Local

4. Perform commands for `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`.

## Git Remote

5. Access your GitHub Repository: Go to the GitHub website and log in to your account.
6. Navigate to the repository for this exercise.
7. Watch for the Red X (or yellow dot as the test runs) to change to the green check mark. The green check mark on a GitHub repository indicates that the commit or pull request has been tested and meets the defined criteria for correctness.
8. If there's a red "X" instead, it means the tests have failed. You'll need to investigate and fix the issues in VScode, then perform the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` steps again.

## Grade in Canvas

9. The status in Canvas does not change to Complete until an Instructor has reviewed your assignment. This process is similar to the Code review process in a real work scenario. A code review by an instructor or a senior developer after unit tests pass is an important step in the software development process. It helps ensure that the code not only functions correctly but also adheres to best practices, coding standards, and maintainability guidelines.

You are all set!
